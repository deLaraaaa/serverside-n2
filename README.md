The work consists in:
1. Choose a relational database, create it, and define how the database will be accessed.
2. Conduct research and define a framework for converting objects to JSON.
3. It will generate a sorted array (with integers) and must randomize the array.
4. Conduct research and define an algorithm for sorting an array of integers.
5. Choose one or more libraries to implement charts and download an image to the computer. The following charts should be generated:
  a. Scatter Plots
  b. Line Charts
  c. Bar Charts
  d.Bubble Charts
  e.Dot Plots

1. Used sqlite3 for the database
2. Used jsonify
3. Algorithm Fisher-Yates to randomize
4. Algorithm Merge Sort to sort randomized numbers
5. Used the library Matplotlib
